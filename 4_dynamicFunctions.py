# Dynamic Functions Practice #1
# Create a function (all_positives) that returns True if all the values in a list are positive, and False if at least one of the values is negative. Create a list named numbers with positive and negative values.

# Don't call the function, you just need to define it.

list = [1,99,-5,4,2]
def all_positives():
    for num in list:
        if num < 0:
            return True
        else:
            return False

print(all_positives())

# Dynamic Functions Practice #2
# Create a function (sum_less) that adds the numbers of a list as long as they are greater than 0 and less than 1000, and returns the result of said sum. Create a numbers variable, storing a list of numbers so we can test it.

# list_2 = [4,2000,54,697]
# def sum_less():
#     for num in list_2:
#         if num > 0 < 1000:
#             sum += num
#             return sum
        
# print(sum_less)




# Dynamic Functions Practice #3
# Create a function (count_even) that counts the number of even numbers that exist in a list (numbers), and returns the result of said count.
